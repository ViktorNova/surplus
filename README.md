Samplefucker
============

listen to audio samples in an easily-navigable file browser made for the task. when you find what you want drag&drop it into your preferred environment (theoretically--in practice I've only found [Carla](http://github.com/falkTX/Carla) to work with this so far). It'd be cool if eventually it is extended to utilize keyboard shortcuts to send samples to other LAU programs or something.

plugin browsing (ladspa,dssi,lv2,vst) to come hopefully.
